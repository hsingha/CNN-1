Topic: Detecting changes in Global Biodiversity Using Keras Tensorflow

The PDF file attached contains the entire description of the dataset and the project outcomes, summary etc. I used Google Collab to run and test the code, in order to get results, mount the dataset file "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KjkdIkfRLZ3kLpjkmbV-HfAOuS7qxIHT?usp=sharing" onto your Google Drive.

The code can be seen on the file "Code.py"
